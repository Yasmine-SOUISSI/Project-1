<p>According to the home’s listing, the Mediterranean Revival style mansion was built in 1929 by architect A.K. Kellogg, and comes complete with six bedrooms and eleven bathrooms, a separate guest apartment above the garage, and elevator access to all floors.</p>
<p>The home’s stunning entrance features an expansive well-manicured lawn leading up to an elaborate arch doorway and arch windows, enhanced by oak trees and Italian cypress. The backyard is equally as magnificent with a dining area located within the home’s dreamy loggia, open to views of the lawn, mosaic-tiled pool, and a trellised section that continues the property’s Mediterranean theme.</p>

<p>Upstairs, the primary suite stands out with a full sitting area, double bathrooms, and double walk-in closets. The site also reports that if sold for the asking price, the property will be one of the most expensive homes sold in the area.</p>

Mr. LaMontagna didn’t disclose why the couple is selling their Encino compound, but said that they have already moved out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is the plight of every residential developer to manage the constant march of time with the impermanence of trends. In the few years it takes to complete construction, prevailing styles may change and what was once set to be fashionable can quickly become dated.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76148" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" data-id="76148" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-3-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-3-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>But the modish and the enduring don’t always have to be exclusive, says Frederick Chin, who serves as CEO of <u><a href="https://www.theviewpointcollection.com/">Viewpoint Collection</a></u>, a Los Angeles-based luxury real estate developer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76149" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1820" data-id="76149" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-2.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-2-400x364.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-2-1024x932.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-2-768x699.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-2-1536x1398.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-2-150x137.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>“Customer tastes and trends change; it’s more important to choose the finest materials and a design that is both current and timeless. This perspective is reinforced by the protracted time needed to build a custom home. For example, what was in vogue five years ago: black stone, polished materials, specialized facilities are not as functional today as they were then. We consciously chose not to go that route and the result has been incredibly successful,” Chin shares.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76150" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-11.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" data-id="76150" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-11.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-11-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-11-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-11-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-11-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-11-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Viewpoint Collection, launched by Chin in 2019, has used that mindset to set the bar for residential development in Los Angeles. Viewpoint Collection homes are highly sought after in residential circles and often command record prices. Its latest project, a 17,401-square-foot mansion set in the hills of Bel-Air, underscores those same principles, according to listing agent Drew Fenton of Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>

<p>Designed by Zoltan Pali, the renowned architect behind the Wallis Anneberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, the new construction home is fronted by an impressive modernist exterior with Indiana limestone and curved, bronze metalwork cladding, blending natural elements with artful techniques.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76154" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-7.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1556" data-id="76154" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-7.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-7-400x311.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-7-1024x797.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-7-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-7-1536x1195.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-7-150x117.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Skillful implementation of raw materials is something of a motif throughout the three-story structure.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76155" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-13.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" data-id="76155" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-13.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-13-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-13-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-13-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-13-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-13-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Massive walls of travertine stone meet French walnut floors and partitions of wood panels provide unimposing division to the homes sprawling first floor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76156" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-14.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" data-id="76156" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-14.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-14-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-14-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-14-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-14-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-14-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Not all of the home’s accents, however, are manufactured—a two-story courtyard houses a mature olive tree whose winding branches reach the windows of the first floor, where the primary suite is located.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76157" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-15.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" data-id="76157" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-15.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-15-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-15-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-15-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-15-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-15-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>At the other end of the first floor is the dining room, living room and guest quarters. An open kitchen featuring a Ceopp di Gre countertop, a blend of Miele, Wolf, and Sub-Zero appliances, also holds a corner breakfast area.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76158" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-10.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" data-id="76158" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-10.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-10-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-10-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-10-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-10-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-10-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Moving glass walls are found in almost every living space throughout the eight-bedroom, 11-bathroom home, making for seamless indoor-outdoor living and easy access to the various decks and balconies and the lower level sundeck with infinity pool and spa.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76159" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-16.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" data-id="76159" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-16.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-16-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-16-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-16-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-16-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-16-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>The lower level, which also includes additional en-suite bedrooms, a gym and a wellness center, can be reached by a central staircase partially enclosed by foam concrete walls or a sleek metal and glass elevator.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76160" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-6.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1573" data-id="76160" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-6.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-6-400x315.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-6-1024x805.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-6-768x604.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-6-1536x1208.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-6-150x118.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>One story down, the lowest level includes staff quarters, a movie theater and a wine room.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76161" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-17.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" data-id="76161" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-17.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-17-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-17-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-17-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-17-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Small-17-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Regardless of the current, popular styles and trends, the property’s perched location along a sloped vista in the heart of Bel-Air with extensive views of the city below is sure to never go out of fashion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sited on one of Venice Beach’s envied walk streets this rare double-lot property carries not just celebrity provenance but an architectural pedigree and the boasting rights to a stand-out facade made of repurposed Hollywood Bowl seats. Moments from Venice Beach proper and the Historic Canals this unique home was brought to life by locally based S.E.A Architects and their award winning founder David Hertz, FAIA.</p>

<p>S.E.A. and Hertz are acknowledged leaders in sustainable architecture and regenerative design. With over three decades of experience in the practice and innovation of green building it is of no surprise that when the opportunity arose to recycle the original 1919 Cedar benches from one of LA’s most iconic venues the LEED accredited firm used the weathered boards as cladding for their 2019 contemporary project.</p>

<p>Listed with Gary Gold, the 7,102 sq ft modern, open floor plan features a living/dining space and bar as well as an at-home gym, sauna, pool, and jacuzzi. Four, spacious second floor en-suite bedrooms are topped by a panoramic roof deck with chef&#8217;s kitchen and den.

<p>Venice is home to a venerable array of architectural styles, its eclectic offerings are as varied as its residents, founded in 1905 by Abbot Kinney, the resort community has long attracted a bastien of design-led practitioners. Charles and Ray Eames set up their design studio there in 1943, and many of the ‘surf-shack’ craftsman bungalows remain but they now sit among an era of modernity, ushered in by Frank Gehry, Steven Erlich and Fred Fisher.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Green Gables, where man&#8217;s and nature&#8217;s best are brilliantly on display. Since its inception in 1911, this sprawling 74-acre estate has been a culmination of celebrated architecture, rich provenance, and sophisticated grandeur. This exclusive Silicon Valley haven is represented by Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>

<p>While Silicon Valley is home to the global center of technological innovation, Green Gables also remains an enduring connection to a pioneering California of long ago. It&#8217;s a bridge between then and now, a property steeped in Bay Area lore. At the turn of the 20th century, prominent entrepreneur, visionary and philanthropist, Mortimer Fleishhacker, Sr., and his artist wife, Bella Gerstle Fleishhacker, amassed nine parcels in the leafy Northern California enclave of Woodside, and transformed them into one of the most magnificent residences in the world, a loving homage to their extensive travels to the English and Italian countryside. Five generations later, Green Gables has never changed hands and remains in the Fleishhacker family, each generation of which has meticulously stewarded the estate for over a century.</p>

<p>Rick Hilton, President and Founder of Hilton &amp; Hyland states, &#8220;Once in a while, on very rare occasions, a new property comes to market that exceeds all expectations, that despite all of the magnificent homes we have been so privileged to represent over the years, simply stands out for its beauty, grandeur, and heritage. Green Gables is such a place.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77272" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_25.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1313" data-id="77272" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_25.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_25-400x263.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_25-1024x672.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_25-768x504.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_25-1536x1008.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_25-150x98.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>He continues, &#8220;To experience it in all of its splendor, to recognize its undeniable role in California&#8217;s history, and then to imagine what dreams its next fortunate owner will realize there, is as equally exciting as it is an honor.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77273" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_26.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1313" data-id="77273" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_26.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_26-400x263.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_26-1024x672.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_26-768x504.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_26-1536x1008.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Green-Gables_LoRes_26-150x98.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>The multi-generational compound bears the stamp of legendary architects and leaders of the early 20th century Arts and Crafts movement, Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene. The duo&#8217;s visionary design ensured that the estate&#8217;s astounding landscapes were beautifully integrated with the spectacular views of the Silicon valley and the pristine Santa Cruz Mountains.</p>
<p>Bringing Cotswold charm to the West Coast, Green Gables marries the enchanting beauty of its classic architecture with an oasis of sustainable and therapeutic living. Boasting seven residences, three swimming pools, including California&#8217;s first-ever free-form swimming pool, a 60-by-300-foot Roman-style reflecting pool, a tennis court, and a large spring-fed reservoir sustaining much of the estate&#8217;s irrigation, an orchard, as well as endless natural habitats and bountiful vegetable and flower gardens, it is no surprise the estate is often revered as one of the most spectacular estates in the country.</p>

<p>These opulent features and spectacular setting explain why the home has attracted so many artists, visionaries and dignitaries over the years – from hosting European royalty to serving as the venue for the United Nations&#8217; 20th anniversary gala.</p>

<p>&#8220;If once-in-a-lifetime were a place, it would be Green Gables. It is a rare privilege to represent one of the grandest architectural treasures of our country. Where an established history meets a sustainable present, the next chapter in this estate&#8217;s legacy will be exciting to witness. In a myriad of ways Green Gables is a blank canvas, ready for the next visionary&#8217;s imprint.&#8221; Zach Goldsmith exclaims.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the key aspects of remodeling a Midcentury Modern home—the popular architectural style with surprising staying power—is maintaining the structure’s original character while implementing updates that suit a 21st-century lifestyle, or so says Los Angeles-based designer-turned-developer Philippe Naouri.</p>
<p>Specializing in Midcentury restoration, Naouri has renovated and re-imagined some of Los Angeles’ most prized Modernist gems, including one of his most recently completed projects, a $24.95 million Trousdale Estates mansion.</p>
<p><iframe class="lazyload" title="YouTube video player"  data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BaiKnrtQv7Q" width="100%" height="620" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>“Nobody really wanted to take on the project because the house was a historical house—so you have to save it,” shared the French-born designer in a recent video tour of the six-bedroom, eight-bathroom abode.</p>
<p>“Everything is actually original. We were very careful on recreating the original woodwork.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minimalist residence was built in 1959 for Parisian actress Corinne Calvet, with designs by master architect Rex Lotery, a somewhat under-appreciated genius, according to Naouri.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70711" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-19.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1294" data-id="70711" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-19.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-19-400x259.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-19-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-19-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-19-1536x994.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-19-150x97.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>“Lotery was one of the greatest architects of the 20th century, but he’s only known by the people who really know architecture.”</p>
<p>The property was eventually purchased by Naouri in 2017, who along with Eric Choi at Maison d’Artiste and in collaboration with Studio Tim Campbell, set about on the four-and-a-half-year restoration with impressive results.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70699" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-7.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1294" data-id="70699" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-7.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-7-400x259.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-7-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-7-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-7-1536x994.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-7-150x97.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Originally 4,300 square feet, the home was expanded to more than double the size, coming in at 8,800 square feet.</p>
<p>Staples of Midcentury styling can be seen in the selection of materials such as rich wood accents, terrazzo floors and the use of muted stone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70709" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-17.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1294" data-id="70709" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-17.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-17-400x259.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-17-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-17-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-17-1536x994.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-17-150x97.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Light pours through walls of glass, clerestory windows and skylights. An airy feel is further amplified by the open floor layout, as well as an atrium and see-through fireplace.</p>
<p>Modern amenities such as a temperature-controlled wine room, spacious screening room and spa bathrooms make for a dwelling of contemporary comforts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70693" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1294" data-id="70693" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-1-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-1-1-400x259.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-1-1-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-1-1-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-1-1-1536x994.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1061-1-1-150x97.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Centering the more than half-acre property is a uniquely-shaped zero-edge pool that mirrors the lines of the home’s exterior. Brazilian-inspired landscaping and a hillside position give both intimacy and privacy.</p>
<p>Listed by Mick Partridge of Beverly Hills-based Hilton &amp; Hyland, the modern masterpiece at 1061 Loma Vista, Beverly Hills, may have undergone extensive updates but the appeal has remained quintessentially Midcentury, Naouri says.</p>
<p>“We doubled the size of the house but nobody can tell because it was made with respect to the architecture.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone’s favorite stony, jazz-loving, small-screen gumshoe is back! Less than one year after “Bosch” ended its seven-season run on Amazon Prime, the show’s highly-anticipated spinoff, aptly titled “Bosch: Legacy,” has hit the streamer’s ad-supported sister platform, Freevee (formerly known as IMDb TV). Set a year and a half after the events of the original’s series finale and based upon best-selling author Michael Connelly’s 2016 novel “The Wrong Side of Goodbye,” “Legacy” sees titular character Hieronymus “Harry” Bosch (Titus Welliver) trading in his badge to work as a private eye, with his daughter, Maddie (Madison Lintz), following in his law enforcement footsteps by joining the ranks of the LAPD Hollywood Division. And dare I say, it’s even better than its predecessor!</p>
<p><iframe class="lazyload" title="YouTube video player"  data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QcyuM2KrBb4" width="100%" height="620" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Gritty, gripping and intense, the inaugural season’s storyline revolves around Bosch and adversary-turned-associate Honey Chandler (Mimi Rogers) working together to take down villainous hedge fund manager Carl Rogers (originally played by Max E. Williams, the role was recast with Michael Rose for the spinoff) after he skates on a murder-for-hire charge thanks to a hung jury. The fact that episodes are being released piecemeal only serves to make “Legacy” all the more enthralling.</p>
<p>There is bad news when it comes to “Bosch’s” best-known location, though. The cantilevered pad Harry called home on the original series gets red-tagged following an earthquake in episode one, forcing the detective to temporarily move into his office. While the turn of events is heartbreaking, it is necessary for the narrative. Welliver explained to TVLine, “I think the idea is to sort of ‘separate Harry from his perch,’ and disorient him. But it was very much a big part of a discussion, and it’s by design. So, yes, the fans should kind of look at it, observe it and be concerned and then, ultimately, kind of figure that as with all things we do, we paint Harry into a corner and then give him a brush to paint his way out.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, as Bosch decides whether or not to make the pricey repairs required to save his beloved homestead or to cut bait and sell, audiences can instead feast their eyes upon another dazzling piece of real estate, the contemporary manse belonging to Rogers, which figures front and center in the storyline.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77027" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-MLS.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1200" data-id="77027" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-MLS.jpg 1800w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-MLS-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-MLS-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-MLS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-MLS-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-MLS-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /></p>
<p>In a rather humorous twist, the architectural stunner can be found a literal stone’s throw away from Harry’s house at 1 Bode Dr. in the Hollywood Hills. In fact, some of the best views of Harry’s place can be had from the foot of the dwelling’s driveway! So Bosch certainly didn’t have to go far to surveil Rogers! (Please remember this is a private home. Do not trespass or bother the residents or the property in any way.)</p>
<p>Situated atop a private bluff overlooking virtually all of Los Angeles, the estate is the brainchild of celebrity architect Michael Mueller, who spent more than eight years on the project (the permits alone took two years to secure!) before it was finally completed in 2019. He detailed to Forbes, “Back in 2003, I was driving around looking for properties up in the hills and I came across this tiny little sign at the bottom of the hill that said, ‘For sale by owner.’ So I rang the buzzer. Someone came down the hill. Mind you, there was no house here; it was just all mountain. And guess who it was? It was Leslie Nielsen!” The “Naked Gun” actor, who had owned the lot since 1951, was apparently supremely protective of it, only agreeing to sell to Mueller after interviewing him four times and being made privy to his ambitious architectural plans, which required a “carving out of the hilltop to create the most impressive views in Los Angeles, sweeping across the skyline and mountains to the ocean.”</p>
<p>Featuring five bedrooms (all ensuite with walk-in closets) and eight baths spread throughout a whopping 10,000 square feet, the completed residence was certainly worth the wait! And there’s good news for deep-pocketed “Bosch” fans because the pad is currently up for grabs! Repped by Jonathan Nash of Hilton &amp; Hyland, the abode is being offered for $19.99 million.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-77026" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-MLS.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1201" data-id="77026" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-MLS.jpg 1800w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-MLS-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-MLS-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-MLS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-MLS-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-MLS-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /></p>
<p>Sited on a sprawling 0.99-acre lot at the end of a long, gated driveway, the residence is a wonderland of views and indoor/outdoor space, with walls of glass making up almost the entire rear side. Mueller told Forbes, “This property had to be all about glass, all about floating. The big key design is that the inside becomes the outside, especially in California where you can leave the doors open.”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69911" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8-MLS-1.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1201" data-id="69911" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8-MLS-1.jpg 1800w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8-MLS-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8-MLS-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8-MLS-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8-MLS-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8-MLS-1-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /></p>
<p>Inside, generous living spaces, all exhibiting a Hollywood Regency flair, abound. An entertainer’s showcase, common areas include a media room, an office, a library, a fitness studio, a formal dining room backed by a wine wall, a kitchen outfitted with dual islands and high-end appliances, and three separate living rooms, one with a towering double-sided fireplace enveloped in granite.</p>
<p>Jetliner views stretching from downtown L.A. to the Santa Monica Mountains greet residents at nearly every turn. As Mueller expressed to Forbes, “I would say that living in this house is like living in the sky in a modern world where you are surrounded by all the beauty that Los Angeles has to offer.”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76141" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25-MLS.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1201" data-id="76141" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25-MLS.jpg 1800w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25-MLS-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25-MLS-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25-MLS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25-MLS-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/25-MLS-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /></p>
<p>The primary bedroom is a genuine retreat made complete by a fireplace fashioned out of black slab stone, a chandelier custom-designed by Mueller and a two-story dressing room featuring hand-scraped oak flooring.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76142" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26-MLS.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1201" data-id="76142" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26-MLS.jpg 1800w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26-MLS-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26-MLS-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26-MLS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26-MLS-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26-MLS-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /></p>
<p>But it is the ensuite bath that is truly jaw-dropping! Boasting a central standalone soaking tub, custom vanities and dual showers outfitted with Italian blue quartz, the enclave looks more like it belongs in a tony spa or an exclusive hotel than a private home.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Luxury interior architecture is often designed with art in mind—blank spans of wall for large paintings, open spaces for sculpture.

<p>Sitting a few blocks away from the beach, the 3,400-square-foot contemporary compound houses the first residential commissioned artwork by famed French street artist Invader.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76842" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_036.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" data-id="76842" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_036.jpg 1200w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_036-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_036-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_036-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_036-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The anonymous artist’s signature pixelated mosaic work can be seen from the street behind a hedged fence on the outside corner of one of the property’s multiple structures.</p>
<p>Partially inspired by the urban warehouses of Austin and Los Angeles, and railroad-station-turned-arts-center Bergamot Station near Santa Monica, the home’s facade features sleek corrugated metal with pops of vibrant orange, pink and green accenting the black industrial hull.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76841" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_029.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" data-id="76841" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_029.jpg 1200w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_029-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_029-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_029-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/813Palms_029-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Other prominent artworks include a mural paying homage to the late singer-songwriter and artist Daniel Johnston covering the side of the two-story studio/garage.</p>
<p>Artistic flair is not just on the outside. High, exposed ceilings, polished concrete floors and colorful statement walls evoke a fashionable factory befitting Warhol’s superstars.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46136" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_16-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1338" data-id="46136" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_16-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_16-1-400x268.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_16-1-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_16-1-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_16-1-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_16-1-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Walls of glass and bi-folding doors throughout the three-bedroom, five-bathroom compound allow for the many exterior works to be admired from both inside and out.</p>
<p>In the main house, open concept space is gently divided by a split-level floor plan, with stairs ascending to the kitchen and dining area. The airy primary suite encompasses the entire second story.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45846" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_7.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1338" data-id="45846" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_7.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_7-400x268.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_7-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_7-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_7-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_7-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Also found on the Abbot Kinney adjacent property is a detached studio with a bathroom and a sunken courtyard, two roof decks and two covered parking spaces.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45856" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1338" data-id="45856" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_18.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_18-400x268.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_18-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_18-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_18-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/813Palms_18-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time the Spelling Manor changed hands was in 2019, when it sold to an undisclosed buyer for $119.75 million—the highest recorded residential sale ever for Los Angeles County at the time.</p>
<p>Fast-forward three years and the famed estate’s current price of $165 million wouldn’t come close to breaking the new California record set a year ago when venture capitalist Marc Andreessen paid $177 million for a property in Malibu.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76777" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1590" data-id="76777" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-1-400x318.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-1-1024x814.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-1-768x611.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-1-1536x1221.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-1-150x119.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Still, the $165-million sticker price ranks as one of the highest in the country for a single-family residence.</p>
<p>Weighing in at more than 56,000 square feet, the French chateau-inspired estate was originally built for late TV producer Aaron Spelling and his widow, Candy Spelling. Sparing no expense, Candy Spelling customized the sprawling residence with a range of personalized amenity rooms, including a flower-cutting room, a film editing area behind the screen of the home’s movie theater and a wine and cheese room outfitted with Parisian-cafe style tables and chairs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76778" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-28.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1556" data-id="76778" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-28.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-28-400x311.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-28-1024x797.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-28-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-28-1536x1195.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-28-150x117.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Prior to the record sale in 2019, the home was owned by Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone, who had paid $85 million for the place in an all-cash deal.</p>
<p>During her residency, Ecclestone oversaw sweeping renovations, updating interiors to suit modern tastes and adding a beauty salon, an aquarium and a nightclub.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76779" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-17.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" data-id="76779" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-17.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-17-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-17-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-17-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-17-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Covering well over an acre of livable space, the home features 27 bathrooms and 14 bedrooms, including the 7,500-square-foot primary suite.</p>
<p>Other points of interest include a French-door solarium, a formal dining room and a grand foyer featuring a 30-foot ceiling, as well as a game room, a bowling alley and a tanning room.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76780" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-20.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" data-id="76780" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-20.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-20-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-20-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-20-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-20-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-20-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>In an interview with Forbes last year, Ecclestone’s partner, real estate agent and lifestyle entrepreneur Sam Palmer, revealed that the 123-room, W-shaped mansion requires a staff of 50 people to keep the estate in working order.</p>
<p>A team of landscapers tends to grounds featuring rose gardens, citrus orchards and acres of lawn. In addition, the home’s many fountains, the statuary, koi ponds, swimming pool and sports courts all require regular maintenance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76781" src="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" data-id="76781" srcset="https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-18.jpg 2000w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-18-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-18-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-18-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiltonhyland.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Manor-18-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p>Sited on 4.7 acres in tony Holmby Hills, the property borders the Los Angeles Golf Club and is down the street from other well-known residences such as the Gregory Peck Estate and the Playboy Mansion.</p>
